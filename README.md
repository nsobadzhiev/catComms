catComms
========

CatComms is a Perl command-line utility that lets you share files across all computers 
in your network, also allowing you to copy only the ones relevant to that machine 
(all done based on categories).

Just supply a category name in fileIndex.pl or in the catCommIndex utility to link a file to a category
and tis file will only be copied to computers that are interested in it.
